```java
    // Test with a single consonant character
    String result1 = remove_vowels("b"); // Should pass both assertions.

    // Test with a string that starts with a consonant and a vowel is omitted
    String result2 = remove_vowels("bcd"); // Should pass all assertions.

    // Test with a string with only one consonant and ensure length is greater than 1
    String result3 = remove_vowels("bc"); // Should pass all assertions.
