```java
public static void main(String args[]) { 
    int[] lst = {1, 1}; 
    // This array has only one unique number, yielding an array of length 1 when duplicates are removed.
    // The second assertFalse condition will pass because 1 < 2 is false and the program will not proceed 
    // to the return line, which guarantees that no actual return is made. 
}
```
